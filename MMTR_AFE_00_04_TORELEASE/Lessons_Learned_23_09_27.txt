-Pi pico form factor was not the best idea - make something surface mount and
	with IO built in, or at least use SMD footprint/headers
-Surface mount packages for modules - at least go headers or something, or make it castelations only
All those digital busses to every module is a routing nightmare
having IO expanders near the parts was useful.  Did mean giant busses, but not parallel though
Plan big digital busses during placement
Plan power/common planes during placement
Two radio modules sucks; unify
separate the 422 isolation as a module
unused space under fuses - can I do anything with that?
SMALL packages during design - soldering is fine, routing space is hard to come by

KEY THE INPUT MODULE AND FUSES
plan for switch wiring, pick for low-profile switches

Ohm-input protection leaking to main!
source follower - Vdson varied wildly with current: some kind of feedback?  Yeah did some spice in mid-nov
--Solved by just changing the input resistors to pull gate further down

Not enough switches on the display, at least need d pad
input noise filtering (switchable?) maybe even hardware AC.  At least low-pass
buffer the voltage afte the first input, then switches don't need high spec
Probably get rid of PGA as it is, either use ADC or a simpler mux/buffer.  Maybe noise improvement?

The radio burst power is weird, add switching and caps, probably
oh wait no because parasitic on pins, probably vsys?  Something to let programming be normal...
